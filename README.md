# Fourier-Series-illustration

This script helps you visualize the fourier series converging(or actually not) to the true signal, or either to have an insight of the gibbs phenomenon.

The fourier series are valid for a broad class of signals that have a physical sense, maybe the most practical way is checking for Dirichlet conditions, but since no one seeing you, you can apply this to any function you want.
